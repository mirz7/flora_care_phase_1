Got it 🌱 Since your **FloraCare** project is in the **initial stage** (Flask backend + some photos), I’ll draft a clean and professional `README.md` that you can improve later as you add IoT, ML, and other features.

Here’s a suggested **README.md** for your repo:

# 🌱 FloraCare

FloraCare is an intelligent plant disease detection and care assistant.
Currently, the project is in its **initial stage**, built with **Flask** to serve as the backend and provide a foundation for integrating machine learning and IoT features in the future.

---

## 🚀 Features (Current Stage)

* Flask-powered web application
* Upload plant images for testing (demo only)
* Basic templates for UI
* Initial dataset and CSV-based information
* Organized project structure with static & templates folders
* Detailed plant care using hugging face

## 🔮 Roadmap

Planned upcoming features:

* ✅ Plant disease detection using deep learning (CNN)
* ✅ Plant guide generation (AI-powered)
* ✅ IoT device integration (ESP32 + soil/moisture sensors)
* ✅ Community feature (users can post/share tips)
* ✅ Deployment on cloud for real-world usage

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Flask (Python)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (inside templates)
* **Data:** CSV demo data & test images
* **Deployment:** Heroku (Procfile included)

⚡ This keeps it **minimal but professional** for now, while leaving room for growth when you add ML & IoT.

👉 Do you want me to also add a **project logo/banner** (like “FloraCare” with a plant icon) at the top of the README? That makes it look cooler on GitHub.
